\begin{abstract}
  This paper is mostly a case study [for/on] the final tagless approachâ€”which is
  a solution for the \emph{Expression Problem}. We describe how the final
  tagless encoding can help to create truly extensible representations for
  markup documents. This is not a new finding and was first used in the Haskell
  project HSXML.

  We provide a comparison of the FT-encoding with the ADT-encoding that Pandoc
  is using and describe the essential implementation techniques that HSXML is
  using to create a context aware encoding. This context aware FT-encoding has
  great potential for creating a representation that is not only extensible but
  also provides a lot of guarantees in regards to the well-formedness of the
  resulting abstract syntax trees.
