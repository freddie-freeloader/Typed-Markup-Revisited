\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:orgc140eeb}

In the age of digital documents, an author of content is confronted with the
question which document format to choose. Since every document format has its
advantages, one might not want to commit to a specific format to soon. \\
A series of blog posts might turn into a book (or at least a pretty typeset
\emph{pdf}) or an author might want to give the reader the freedom to read
their text on differently sized displays — if the reader has ever tried to read
a paper in \emph{pdf}-format on an e-book reader, no further motivation might
be needed.

Luckily the problem of decoupling initial text from output seems to be solved by
the rise of markup languages such as Markdown and alike. These type of documents
can be easily compile into all sorts of output formats by programs as
\emph{pandoc} \cite{pandoc}.

If the reader has no objections to such a publishing system, they might read no
further and write away their next \emph{format-agnostic} document. But if they
are interested in how they can easily extend the representation of their
document and let a type-checker reason about the \emph{well-formedness} of it,
they may find the findings gathered in this paper worth while.

This paper mostly outlines the ideas of the work on \emph{HSXML: Typed SXML}
\cite{hsxml} and the underlying idea of \emph{Finally Tagless Interpreters}
\cite{finally-tagless}. The \emph{final tagless encoding} is a solution to the
expression problem \cite{expression-problem}. It is closely related to the
problem at hand, in that it is concerned with the simultaneous extension of
syntactic variants and interpretations of them. This can be seen as
an extensibility in two dimensions [add schema like in Object-oriented
programming versus abstract data types].

In short a richly typed representation of documents like \emph{HSXML} has in our
opinion two major advantages over markup languages such as Pandoc’s internal one:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Guarantee the well-formedness of the document by construction
\item Easy extensibility without loosing the guarantees of 1.
\end{enumerate}

While having these two advantages we still do not want to loose perspective and
be true to our initial goal:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Writing documents that are format agnostic—i.e. observe our source in
different ways
\end{enumerate}

or as described in the Wikipedia-article on \emph{Markup Languages}

\begin{quote}
Descriptive markup

Markup is used to label parts of the document rather than to provide specific
instructions as to how they should be processed. Well-known examples include
\LaTeX{}, HTML, and XML. The objective is to decouple the inherent structure of the
document from any particular treatment or rendition of it. Such markup is often
described as "semantic".
\end{quote}

Oleg Kiselyov might want to argue that such a markup is even \emph{symantic} \cite{finally-tagless-tut}.

\section{Extensibility of Markup Representations}
\label{sec:org7537ecb}
\subsection{Extensible Observers}
\label{sec:org5f9818b}

Pandoc achieves the separation of input and output format by choosing an
Algebraic Data Type as its intermediate representation. We will quickly sketch
why such an encoding leads to an easy extensibility of constructors by looking a
subset of Pandoc's Abstract Syntax Tree and writing some observers for it.

Given the representation (Figure \ref{Pandoc_AST}) we can write \emph{observers}
that interpret this data in different ways (Figure \ref{Pandoc_Views}). So in the
dimension of observers our encoding is obviously extensible.

Now we can construct a tree in the host language and interpret it in two
different ways:
\begin{lstlisting}
groceryList :: [Block]
groceryList
  = [ Heading 1  [ Str "Grocery list"]
    , BulletList [ Paragraph [ Str "1 Banana"]
                 , Paragraph [ Str "2 "
                             , Emph [Str "organic"]
                             , Str " Apples"]]]

groceryListCM :: Markdown
groceryListCM = mconcatMap docToCMark groceryList

groceryListLaTeX :: LaTeX
groceryListLaTeX = mconcatMap docToLaTeX groceryList
\end{lstlisting}

We can make our life a bit easier by adding an instance for \emph{IsString} for our
representation. This injects \emph{String} automatically into our data types by
applying \emph{fromString} to it.

\begin{lstlisting}
instance IsString Inline where
  fromString = Str
\end{lstlisting}


Our initial definition is now even more concise:

\begin{lstlisting}
groceryListShort :: [Block]
groceryListShort
  = [ Heading 1  [ "Grocery list"]
    , BulletList [ Paragraph ["1 Banana"]
                 , Paragraph ["2 ", Emph ["organic"], " Apples"] ]]
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}
\begin{lstlisting}
  data Block
  = Paragraph   [Inline] -- ^ Paragraph
  | BulletList  [Block]    -- ^ Bullet list (list of items, each a block)
  | Heading Int [Inline] -- ^ Heading - level (integer) and text (inlines)
  
  data Inline
  = Str String      -- ^ Text (string)
  | EmDash          -- ^ em dash
  | Emph   [Inline] -- ^ Emphasized text (list of inlines)
  | Strong [Inline] -- ^ Strongly emphasized text (list of inlines)
\end{lstlisting}
\captionof{figure}{\label{Pandoc_AST}

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\begin{lstlisting}
docToCMark :: Block -> Markdown
docToCMark (Paragraph text)     = mconcatMap inlineToCMark text
docToCMark (BulletList docs)    = addLineBreak $ mconcatMap (mappend "- " . docToCMark) docs
docToCMark (Heading level text) = addLineBreak $ headingPrefix `mappend` mconcatMap inlineToCMark text
 where
  headingPrefix = mconcat $ replicate level "#"

addLineBreak :: Markdown -> Markdown
addLineBreak text = text `mappend` "\n"

inlineToCMark :: Inline -> Markdown
inlineToCMark (Str content)     = fromString content
inlineToCMARK (Emph contents)   = "*" `mappend` mconcatMap inlineToCMark contents `mappend` "*"
inlineToCMARK (Strong contents) = "**" `mappend` mconcatMap inlineToCMark contents `mappend` "**"
inlineToCMARK EmDash            = "---"

docToLaTex :: Block -> LaTeX
...

inlineToLaTex :: Inline -> LaTeX
...
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Extensible Variants}
\label{sec:orgccbaf12}

The simple ADT encoding works very well, as long as we have foreseen every
variant we might want to create. But as soon as we want to add a new kind of
node (e.g. a node representing the em dash) we are out of luck. Even if we have
access to the original ADT-definition and we could add this new node, this would
break all existing observers that were written for the original set of variants.

\subsection{Relationship to the Expression Problem}
\label{sec:orgb21dca4}

To be extensible in the dimension of observers as well as the dimension of the
variants, while still guaranteeing statically their compatibility, is quite a
challenge and one that is common when writing software. It was coined as the
\emph{Expression Problem} by Wadler \cite{expression-problem} and many solutions
have been proposed.

The most prominent solutions — that are widely used the Haskell-ecosystem — are
described in \emph{Data-types a la carte} \cite{data-types-a-la-carte} and in
\emph{Finally Tagless, Partially Evaluated} \cite{finally-tagless}. Kiselyov’s
et al. solution to this is — in our opinion — both easy to use and when used as
a DSL for our particular problem, the relationship to S-expressions becomes
quite obvious.


\section{Simple Final Tagless Encoding}
\label{sec:org6195637}

Our first attempt to encode our document in the final tagless encoding will not
have the distinction between \emph{Doc} and \emph{Inline} — which was enforced by the
Pandoc-encoding. But later we will see that we are able to recover that property
quite easily with great extensibility properties.

The basic idea of the final tagless encoding is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Create a type class that specifies all our constructors in Church encoding
(Figure \ref{First_Step_FT})
\item Parametrize over the return-type and recursive fields of those constructors
(Figure \ref{Second_Step_FT})
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
\begin{lstlisting}
data Doc where
  Doc :: String -> Doc

instance Monoid (Doc doc) where
  mappend (Doc doc1) (Doc doc2) = Doc $ doc1 `mappend` doc2
  mempty = Doc mempty

-- Constructors

class Block where
  paragraph  ::        [Doc] -> Doc
  bulletList ::        [Doc] -> Doc
  heading    :: Int -> [Doc] -> Doc

class Inline a where
  emDash ::           Doc
  str    :: String -> Doc
  str = Doc
\end{lstlisting}
\captionof{figure}{\label{First_Step_FT}
First Step FT-encoding}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\begin{lstlisting}
-- DocConstraint defined using ConstraintKinds
type DocConstraint doc = (Monoid doc, IsString doc)

newtype Doc doc = Doc doc

instance DocConstraint doc => -- Have to restrict for the use of 'mempty'
  Monoid (Doc doc) where
  mappend (Doc doc1) (Doc doc2) = Doc $ doc1 `mappend` doc2
  mempty = Doc mempty

-- Constructors

class Block a where
  paragraph  ::        [Doc a] -> Doc a
  bulletList ::        [Doc a] -> Doc a
  heading    :: Int -> [Doc a] -> Doc a

class DocConstraint a =>
  Inline a where
  emDash ::           Doc a
  str    :: String -> Doc a
  str = Doc . fromString
\end{lstlisting}
\captionof{figure}{\label{Second_Step_FT}
Second Step FT-encoding}
\end{figure}

The type classes look basically like a GADT-encoding where all recursive
occurrences and the return-type are parametrized over.

The observers will now be instances of theses type classes. The reader might
notice that we cannot use the same carrier type for different interpretations of
our AST — otherwise we would get overlapping instances. This can be quite easily
solved by wrapping the carrier type into a \emph{newtype} and add or derive the
needed instances for it. In our case \emph{Markdown} is simply a \emph{newtype} of
\emph{String}. Therefore the instances for \emph{IsString} and \emph{Monoid} are
straightforward to implement.

\begin{lstlisting}
instance Block Markdown where
  paragraph     = mconcat
  bulletList    = addLineBreak . mconcat . map (mappend "\n- ")
  heading level = addLineBreak . mappend (mconcat $ replicate level "#") . mconcat

addLineBreak :: DocConstraint doc => doc -> doc
addLineBreak text = text `mappend` "\n"
\end{lstlisting}

\clearpage

Let's see how our example from above looks in our new encoding:

\begin{lstlisting}
groceryList
  = [ heading 1  [str "Grocery list"]
    , bulletList [ paragraph [ str "1 Banana"]]
                 , paragraph [ str "2 "
                             , emph [str "fresh"]
                             , str " Apples"] ]
\end{lstlisting}


As before, we can automate the injection of \emph{String} into our encoding by using
the \emph{OverloadedStrings} language pragma. We do this be adding a constraint on
the type classes, so every output format must have an \emph{IsString} instance.

Interestingly \emph{Doc} has now no dependency on \emph{Inline} anymore. In a way this is
not ideal, since we can now construct the following:

\begin{lstlisting}
badHeading = [ heading 1  [ heading 2 [str "Headingception!!"] ] ]
\end{lstlisting}

As noted above, we lost the distinction between \emph{Doc} and \emph{Inline}. But we also
gained something — \emph{Doc} can now be used without \emph{Inline} and we can now also
add new nodes without changing our original data types:

\begin{lstlisting}
class IsString a => MoreStyles a where
  strong :: [a] -> a
  strikethrough :: [a] -> a
\end{lstlisting}

Not only can we now mix those node types at will, but the type of an expression
will reflect which type classes (i.e. algebras) we used for constructing it:

\begin{lstlisting}
stylishText :: (Inline a, MoreStyles a) => a
stylishText = strong [str "Green Tea keeps me awake"]
\end{lstlisting}

That is why the type system can now statically tell us whether we can evaluate
\emph{stylishText} to a particular type. If we wanted to evaluate an expression, that
uses constructors that belong to a type class \emph{X} and we would want to evaluate
the expression to some carrier type \emph{C}, \emph{C} has to be instance of \emph{X}. Since
this is a static property, it can be decided at compile time.


\section{Recover Context Awareness}
\label{sec:org5ba4b2b}

To regain the context awareness of the Pandoc encoding, we add another field
\emph{ctx} to our \emph{Doc} wrapper \ref{ContextWrapper}. The \emph{ctx} is a
phantom type and with its help, we can specify in which context a constructor
can be used. Since phantom types are not materialized on the value level, we are
simply using empty data declarations as context types.

\begin{lstlisting}
-- Context definitions
data InlineCtx
data BlockCtx
\end{lstlisting}

As shown before, the first \emph{Final Tagless encoding} had the disadvantage, that
we could construct a heading inside another heading. To prohibit this, the
\texttt{heading} constructor has the following context-aware definition:

\begin{lstlisting}
heading :: Int -> [DocWithCtx InlineCtx doc] -> DocWithCtx BlockCtx doc
\end{lstlisting}

The type signature states, that the function expects a \emph{DocWithCtx}-wrapper in
the \emph{InlineCtx}-context and returns a wrapper in the \emph{BlockCtx}-context. With
this refined signature a heading inside a heading will be rejected by the type
system.

The set of available contexts should be defined generously, since all
independent extensions of the AST should agree on them. This is obviously are
restriction — but one that might be very valuable.

It is still possible to create context independent constructors. This can be
achieved by parametrizing over the context:

\begin{lstlisting}
qed :: DocWithCtx ctx doc
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{lstlisting}
newtype DocWithCtx ctx doc = DocWithCtx doc
\end{lstlisting}
